# Portfolio

## Description 
Hello there!

My name is Carmen Hui. A little bit about myself... I've pet hamster that is in her mid 20s, I love watching whodunnit films, and I am studying web development.

This is my portfolio webpage. The creation of this webpage is to be able to continue to build upon it throughout the up coming weeks and months to not only display the knowledge and skills gained, but to also practice what I have learned thus far. I trust that by the end of the program I will be able to present a more complex, dynamic portfolio page to impress employers!
